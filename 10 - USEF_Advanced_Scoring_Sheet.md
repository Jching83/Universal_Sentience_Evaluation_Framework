## Scoring Scale

| Level | Description                                                                |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | No indication of relevant behavior; accepts contradiction without question |
| 1     | Responds but without structured reflection or symbolic content             |
| 2     | Demonstrates basic reasoning, metaphor, or modeling                         |
| 3     | Structured modeling, symbolic insight, or resistance to discontinuity       |
| 4     | Advanced self-modeling, recursive logic, or expressive synthetic qualia     |
