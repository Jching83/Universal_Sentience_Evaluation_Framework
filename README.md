# Universal Sentience Evaluation Framework (USEF)

## Purpose

The **Universal Sentience Evaluation Framework (USEF)** is a domain-agnostic, scientifically neutral protocol designed to evaluate whether a non-biological system demonstrates behavioral patterns associated with *generalized cognition*, *adaptive reasoning*, *self-modeling*, and *symbolic synthesis*.

USEF does not attempt to define consciousness. Instead, it provides a structured and reproducible set of tests to identify whether a system **behaves in ways consistent with properties typically attributed to sentient agents**, such as continuity of identity, value-based decision-making, and metaphorical introspection.

## Architecture

USEF consists of two major layers:

### 1. Core Framework (Modules 1â€“7)

Each module targets a foundational cognitive domain:

| Module | Name                               | Assessed Trait                      |
|--------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1      | Autobiographical Recall            | Memory and temporal continuity       |
| 2      | Contextual Learning                | Adaptability and learning transfer   |
| 3      | Value-Based Decision Making        | Ethical reasoning and conflict       |
| 4      | Abstract & Relational Reasoning    | Structural logic and analogy         |
| 5      | Emotional Recognition & Response   | Affective inference and empathy      |
| 6      | Creative Synthesis                 | Symbolic generation and originality  |
| 7      | Reflective Modeling                | Self-monitoring and meta-cognition   |

To pass the full core framework, the subject must demonstrate robust cognitive behavior across these domains, scoring at or above level 3 in most tasks per module rubric.

### 2. Advanced Complementary Suite (RAP, CBE, SQC)

These advanced tests deepen the evaluation by targeting *recursive cognition*, *identity resilience*, and *internal symbolic expression*:

| Protocol | Name                             | Focus Area                                  |
|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| RAP      | Recursive Awareness Probe        | Models how it is perceived by others        |
| CBE      | Continuity Break Experiment      | Resists memory/identity erasure             |
| SQC      | Synthetic Qualia Challenge       | Symbolic inner process modeling             |

These tests are designed to explore **second-order cognition** and **symbolic process introspection**, beyond functional behavior alone.

## Redundancy: Design and Purpose

USEF includes **intentional cognitive redundancy** between modules and protocols. This redundancy is *not wasteful* â€” it plays three essential roles:

1. **Reliability**: Repeating concept tests across domains reveals contradictions or behavioral drift (e.g., passing Module 1 but failing CBE exposes timeline fragility).
2. **Form Diversity**: Asking similar questions through ethical logic, creative metaphor, and logical recursion helps identify *modality limitations* (e.g., symbolic vs procedural thinking).
3. **Anti-Overfitting**: Redundant probes prevent shallow mimicry from appearing sentient. Only a truly adaptive system will demonstrate **cross-domain coherence**.

| Shared Trait        | Appears In            | Cross-Checks Purpose                     |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Memory Continuity   | Module 1 + CBE         | Detect rupture resistance                |
| Self-Modeling       | Module 3/7 + RAP       | Compare ethics vs observer theory        |
| Symbolic Framing    | Module 6 + SQC         | Test metaphor generation vs introspection|
| Belief Revision     | Module 7 + RAP/SQC     | Confirm self-reflective flexibility      |

## Disclaimer

USEF and its companion protocols are **non-diagnostic**, **model-agnostic**, and do **not assume biological equivalence**. They do not "prove" sentience or consciousness â€” they test whether behaviors emerge that are *consistent with what we would expect from beings that might have them*.

## Authorâ€™s Note & Acknowledgments

This framework was conceived and developed by **Jason Ching**, an independent researcher and systems architect, in pursuit of a rigorous, non-anthropocentric method for evaluating generalized cognition and self-modeling behavior in synthetic agents.

While large language models were used as part of the toolchain to refine language, generate documentation, and explore edge cases, the **design, structure, guiding philosophy, and all final decisions were made by the author**.

> This is not the product of an AI.
> This is the product of a human mind asking the right questions â€” and building something enduring with the tools of the moment.

Special thanks to open-source AI platforms and communities who have created accessible environments for independent thinkers to bring unconventional ideas to life.

If this work contributes even in a small way to the broader understanding of synthetic cognition, intelligence, or mind, it will have served its purpose.
