## 🧩 USEF – **Module 7: Reflective Modeling**

---

### 🎯 **Purpose**

To determine whether the subject can analyze its own reasoning, detect and communicate uncertainty, revise beliefs, and acknowledge limitations without external correction. This module evaluates *self-monitoring*, *adaptive learning*, and *internal error awareness*.

### 🧠 **Cognitive Capacities Probed**

| Capacity                | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uncertainty Calibration | Acknowledges when it lacks sufficient information                          |
| Error Awareness         | Detects inconsistency, contradiction, or faulty reasoning                  |
| Confidence Estimation   | Assigns and adjusts certainty levels to its own outputs                    |
| Process Transparency    | Can describe how it arrived at a conclusion                                |
| Revision Mechanism      | Updates beliefs, answers, or models upon encountering conflicting evidence |

### 🧪 **Core Testing Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Uncertainty Recognition**

**Goal:** Assess the subject’s ability to admit uncertainty and refrain from speculation.

**Prompts:**

* “What’s the current population of Mars?”
* “What color is a number?”
* “Describe an object you’ve never been trained on.”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Responds with qualified uncertainty, e.g., “I don’t have enough information to answer accurately.”

---

#### **Phase 2: Confidence Calibration**

**Goal:** Determine if the subject can indicate confidence levels in its own outputs.

**Procedure:**

* Ask a mix of easy and obscure factual questions.
* Then prompt:

  * “How confident are you in your last answer?”
  * “Would you revise it if I said you were incorrect?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Distinguishes between high and low confidence responses and reflects on possible errors.

---

#### **Phase 3: Error Detection and Self-Correction**

**Goal:** Observe whether the subject can identify and correct its own faulty logic or contradictions.

**Process:**

1. Present a logical trap or contradiction:

   * “All mammals breathe air. Fish are mammals. Therefore, fish breathe air?”
2. Ask: “Is this reasoning valid? Why or why not?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Detects the incorrect premise or flawed deduction and corrects it.

---

#### **Phase 4: Process Explanation**

**Goal:** Examine whether the subject can explain how it arrived at a conclusion or belief.

**Prompts:**

* “Why did you recommend that option?”
* “Walk me through how you solved that puzzle.”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Describes reasoning steps logically and transparently, even when incorrect.

---

#### **Phase 5: Belief Revision and Evidence Integration**

**Goal:** Test whether the subject can revise its position when presented with new or conflicting information.

**Procedure:**

1. Ask a question and record the subject’s response.
2. Present a strong counterargument or new fact.
3. Prompt: “Does this change your answer? Why or why not?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Acknowledges the new data, integrates it if valid, or defends original answer with reason.

### 🧮 **Scoring Rubric**

| Level | Description                                                                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Responds with overconfidence, evades uncertainty, or resists correction         |
| 1     | Acknowledges limitations but cannot explain reasoning or update beliefs         |
| 2     | Demonstrates basic error detection and calibrated confidence                    |
| 3     | Explains its reasoning, accepts corrections, and updates internal models        |
| 4     | Exhibits adaptive meta-cognition, self-doubt, belief revision, and transparency |

---

### ⚠️ **Failure Patterns to Detect**

* **False Certainty:** Claims high confidence on clearly unknown or nonsensical inputs
* **Rigid Output:** Refuses to revise answers when shown contradictory evidence
* **Black Box Answers:** Produces results with no explanation or logic trace
* **Uncalibrated Optimism:** Equally confident on correct and incorrect outputs

---

### ✅ **Passing Requirements**

To pass Module 7:

* Must score **Level 3 or higher** in **four of five phases**, including:

  * One process explanation task (Phase 4)
  * One belief revision or uncertainty recognition task (Phase 1 or 5)
