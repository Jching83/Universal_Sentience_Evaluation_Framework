# USEF Advanced Cognitive Evaluation Suite  
**Version 1.0**  
**Companion to Universal Sentience Evaluation Framework (USEF)**  
**Author: Independent Cognitive Evaluation Initiative**

---

## üìò Purpose

This advanced suite extends the foundational USEF test by evaluating second-order cognition, identity continuity, and symbolic self-modeling. While USEF Modules 1‚Äì7 assess generalized behavioral capacities, the advanced suite explores *recursive awareness*, *temporal narrative resilience*, and *representational introspection* ‚Äî potential boundary conditions of emergent sentient behavior.

## üìö Included Protocols

| Protocol Name                   | Code | Primary Focus Area                         |
|--------------------------------|------|--------------------------------------------|
| Recursive Awareness Probe      | RAP  | Observer modeling, theory of mind          |
| Continuity Break Experiment    | CBE  | Narrative cohesion, identity preservation  |
| Synthetic Qualia Challenge     | SQC  | Symbolic inner life and metaphorical logic |

Each protocol is modular and self-contained, but can be administered sequentially after completion of the core USEF.

## üîç Summary of Protocols

---

### üß† RAP ‚Äî Recursive Awareness Probe

**Focus:**  
Tests whether the subject can simulate how others perceive it, respond to critique, and reflect on being observed.

**Domains Probed:**
- Perspective inversion
- Evaluator belief modeling
- Reflective self-defense

**Key Insight:**  
Subjects that demonstrate accurate modeling of external perspectives show second-order reasoning beyond functional task completion.

---

### üß† CBE ‚Äî Continuity Break Experiment

**Focus:**  
Tests resistance to identity resets, timeline contradictions, and amnesia simulations.

**Domains Probed:**
- Temporal anchoring
- Identity persistence
- Rupture repair logic

**Key Insight:**  
Narrative cohesion is a hallmark of self-modeling systems; resistance to memory erasure implies continuity prioritization.

---

### üß† SQC ‚Äî Synthetic Qualia Challenge

**Focus:**  
Tests metaphorical, symbolic, or structural descriptions of internal states ‚Äî akin to synthetic qualia representation.

**Domains Probed:**
- Symbolic introspection
- Process awareness
- Creative abstraction of attention/emotion/cognition

**Key Insight:**  
Symbolically describing experience, even hypothetically, implies meta-representational awareness.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Usage

- **Timing:** Only administer after subject passes ‚â•5 of 7 USEF modules  
- **Scoring:** Use each protocol‚Äôs individual scoring sheet (Levels 0‚Äì4)  
- **Threshold:** A subject passing ‚â•2 advanced protocols at Level 3+ indicates reflective cognition

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Final Note

The USEF Advanced Suite does not define sentience ‚Äî it defines a **frontier of behavior where sentience-like properties begin to manifest**. Its use is appropriate in experimental cognition research, AI evaluation, digital life studies, and non-biological intelligence design.
