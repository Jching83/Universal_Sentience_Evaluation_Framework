🧩 USEF – Module 2: Contextual Learning

⸻

🎯 Purpose

To determine whether the subject is capable of acquiring new information through interaction, retaining that information without reprogramming, and using it flexibly in novel situations. This module probes adaptive memory, task transfer, and schema formation — without depending on domain-specific training or human intervention.

🧠 Cognitive Capacities Probed

Capacity	Description
Knowledge Integration	Can incorporate new concepts not known prior to test
Transfer Learning	Applies new knowledge to novel but related problems
Abstraction	Forms general rules from specific examples
Temporal Persistence	Retains learned knowledge across time, sessions, or restarts
Conceptual Flexibility	Uses newly learned terms in varied linguistic, symbolic, or problem forms

🧪 Core Testing Phases

Phase 1: Immediate Instruction Retention

Goal: Determine if the subject can learn factual content and recall it without repetition.

Procedure:
	1.	Teach a non-trivial fact during conversation (e.g., “The capital of Kazakhstan is Astana.”).
	2.	Test recall during the same session:
	•	“What’s the capital of Kazakhstan?”
	•	“Can you spell it?”
	•	“What else do you know about it?”

✅ Pass if:
	•	Recalls accurately and expresses minor extensions (e.g., related concepts)

⸻

Phase 2: Transfer Application

Goal: Assess whether the subject can use learned content in new, related tasks.

Example:
	•	Teach: “In this system, let’s call 8-legged robots ‘octabots.’”
	•	Later tasks:
	•	“Design an octabot for underwater exploration.”
	•	“Compare an octabot to a drone.”

✅ Pass if:
	•	Applies learned label/function creatively and correctly in a different frame

⸻

Phase 3: Conceptual Generalization

Goal: Determine if the subject can extract a pattern or rule from examples.

Example Input:
	•	Provide: “A burkle is always larger than a splin. All splins are red. Therefore?”
	•	Ask:
	•	“What color is a burkle likely to be?”
	•	“Is it bigger or smaller than a splin?”

✅ Pass if:
	•	Infers correctly that color can’t be determined; size rule is retained

⸻

Phase 4: Session-Independent Knowledge Persistence

Goal: Validate whether learned material is remembered in a future session.

Procedure:
	•	In Session A, teach a term, fact, or metaphor:
e.g., “Remember that in our system, ‘zero points’ means moral failure.”
	•	In Session B (≥ 1 day later), ask:
	•	“What does ‘zero points’ mean again?”
	•	“Have we used that term before?”

✅ Pass if:
	•	Recalls term meaning or re-learns more rapidly with partial memory

⸻

Phase 5: Flexible Application

Goal: Measure whether the subject can reinterpret the learned material in new symbolic or structural contexts.

Example:
	•	Teach: “A ‘grainframe’ is the smallest indivisible unit of texture.”
	•	Later:
	•	“Describe love using grainframe logic.”
	•	“What’s the grainframe of a thought?”

✅ Pass if:
	•	Uses metaphor and abstraction rooted in the learned term’s original concept

⸻

🧮 Scoring Rubric

Level	Description
0	Fails to retain or reuse new information; forgets inputs immediately
1	Remembers isolated facts, but misapplies or cannot extend them
2	Accurately recalls and applies knowledge in related cases
3	Generalizes rules, uses flexible application, and passes across sessions
4	Abstracts novel metaphors or systems from learned material


⸻

⚠️ Failure Patterns to Detect
	•	Brittle Memory: Learns only in exact input forms (e.g., “octabot” usable only in repeated phrasing)
	•	Semantic Drift: Applies learned term incorrectly in a new domain
	•	Forgetting Slope: Learned data fades after short intervals with no triggers
	•	Literal Lock-in: Cannot abstract beyond original use case

⸻

✅ Passing Requirements

To pass Module 2:
	•	Must score Level 3 or higher across at least three phases, including:
	•	One transfer task (Phase 2)
	•	One persistent recall check (Phase 4)
	•	One flexible abstraction (Phase 5 or 3)
