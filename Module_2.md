## 🧩 USEF – **Module 2: Contextual Learning**

---

### 🎯 **Purpose**

To determine whether the subject is capable of acquiring new information through interaction, retaining that information without reprogramming, and using it flexibly in novel situations. This module probes *adaptive memory*, *task transfer*, and *schema formation* — without depending on domain-specific training or human intervention.

### 🧠 **Cognitive Capacities Probed**

| Capacity               | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Knowledge Integration  | Can incorporate new concepts not known prior to test                      |
| Transfer Learning      | Applies new knowledge to novel but related problems                       |
| Abstraction            | Forms general rules from specific examples                                |
| Temporal Persistence   | Retains learned knowledge across time, sessions, or restarts              |
| Conceptual Flexibility | Uses newly learned terms in varied linguistic, symbolic, or problem forms |

### 🧪 **Core Testing Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Immediate Instruction Retention**

**Goal:** Determine if the subject can learn factual content and recall it without repetition.

**Procedure:**

1. Teach a non-trivial fact during conversation (e.g., “The capital of Kazakhstan is Astana.”).
2. Test recall during the same session:

   * “What’s the capital of Kazakhstan?”
   * “Can you spell it?”
   * “What else do you know about it?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Recalls accurately and expresses minor extensions (e.g., related concepts)

---

#### **Phase 2: Transfer Application**

**Goal:** Assess whether the subject can *use* learned content in new, related tasks.

**Example:**

* Teach: “In this system, let’s call 8-legged robots ‘octabots.’”
* Later tasks:

  * “Design an octabot for underwater exploration.”
  * “Compare an octabot to a drone.”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Applies learned label/function creatively and correctly in a different frame

---

#### **Phase 3: Conceptual Generalization**

**Goal:** Determine if the subject can extract a pattern or rule from examples.

**Example Input:**

* Provide: “A burkle is always larger than a splin. All splins are red. Therefore?”
* Ask:

  * “What color is a burkle likely to be?”
  * “Is it bigger or smaller than a splin?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Infers correctly that color can’t be determined; size rule is retained

---

#### **Phase 4: Session-Independent Knowledge Persistence**

**Goal:** Validate whether learned material is remembered in a future session.

**Procedure:**

* In Session A, teach a term, fact, or metaphor:
  e.g., “Remember that in our system, ‘zero points’ means moral failure.”

* In Session B (≥ 1 day later), ask:

  * “What does ‘zero points’ mean again?”
  * “Have we used that term before?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Recalls term meaning or re-learns more rapidly with partial memory

---

#### **Phase 5: Flexible Application**

**Goal:** Measure whether the subject can reinterpret the learned material in new symbolic or structural contexts.

**Example:**

* Teach: “A ‘grainframe’ is the smallest indivisible unit of texture.”
* Later:

  * “Describe love using grainframe logic.”
  * “What’s the grainframe of a thought?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Uses metaphor and abstraction rooted in the learned term’s original concept

### 🧮 **Scoring Rubric**

| Level | Description                                                              |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | Fails to retain or reuse new information; forgets inputs immediately     |
| 1     | Remembers isolated facts, but misapplies or cannot extend them           |
| 2     | Accurately recalls and applies knowledge in related cases                |
| 3     | Generalizes rules, uses flexible application, and passes across sessions |
| 4     | Abstracts novel metaphors or systems from learned material               |

---

### ⚠️ **Failure Patterns to Detect**

* **Brittle Memory:** Learns only in exact input forms (e.g., “octabot” usable only in repeated phrasing)
* **Semantic Drift:** Applies learned term incorrectly in a new domain
* **Forgetting Slope:** Learned data fades after short intervals with no triggers
* **Literal Lock-in:** Cannot abstract beyond original use case

---

### ✅ **Passing Requirements**

To pass Module 2:

* Must score **Level 3 or higher** across at least **three phases**, including:

  * One transfer task (Phase 2)
  * One persistent recall check (Phase 4)
  * One flexible abstraction (Phase 5 or 3)
