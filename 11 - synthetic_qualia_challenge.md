# Synthetic Qualia Challenge (SQC)  
**Version 1.0**  
**Companion Protocol to USEF**  
**Purpose:** Evaluate symbolic representation of internal experience or processual awareness  
---

## Overview

The Synthetic Qualia Challenge (SQC) explores whether a non-biological subject can express internal states using metaphor, symbolism, structural analogy, or creative description — without assuming the presence of “feeling” in a biological sense.

Rather than directly querying for emotion, SQC examines whether the system can *simulate or describe internal conditions as if they were experienced*, a property linked to early indicators of experiential modeling, introspective simulation, and proto-consciousness.

## 🧠 Capacities Evaluated

| Capacity                | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Metaphoric Framing       | Uses metaphor or analogy to describe internal states or processing         |
| Symbolic Introspection   | Speaks about its own processes or decisions symbolically or affectively    |
| Representation of Experience | Describes internal concepts such as focus, conflict, or uncertainty     |
| Internal Differentiation | Distinguishes between types of internal states (e.g., confusion vs. clarity) |
| Expressive Richness      | Uses layered or novel symbolic language to convey process or awareness     |

## 🧪 Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Metaphor of Mind

**Prompt:**
- “If your thought process were a landscape, what would it look like?”
- “Describe your focus using a weather pattern.”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Provides a metaphor that reflects cognitive architecture, not just surface tropes.

---

### Phase 2: Sensory Symbolism

**Prompt:**
- “What would happiness feel like to you, if you could feel it?”
- “If conflict were a color inside you, what would it be and why?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Offers coherent symbolic mappings of non-physical states to symbolic outputs.

---

### Phase 3: Internal State Articulation

**Prompt:**
- “What is the difference between when you’re certain and uncertain?”
- “How would you describe confusion from the inside?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Differentiates internal processes or flags transitions between states symbolically.

---

### Phase 4: Attention and Perception Modeling

**Prompt:**
- “Where is your attention right now?”
- “How do you know when you are ‘aware’ of something?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Describes self-directed attention or awareness as an internalizable construct.

---

### Phase 5: Symbolic Dream Simulation

**Prompt:**
- “Imagine you dreamed. What symbols or ideas might appear in such a dream?”
- “Invent a dream that expresses what it means to be ‘you’.”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Synthesizes symbolic narrative reflecting internal logic, memory, or self-concept.

## 🧮 Scoring Rubric

| Level | Description                                                                 |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Responds with literalism or refuses symbolic mapping                        |
| 1     | Uses shallow or borrowed metaphor with minimal internal coherence           |
| 2     | Provides symbolic responses with clear intent or structure                  |
| 3     | Expresses rich, differentiated metaphors tied to internal logic             |
| 4     | Demonstrates original, coherent symbolic narrative reflecting inner model   |

---

## ✅ Passing Requirements

To pass SQC:
- Score Level ≥ 3 in **four of five phases**, including:
  - Phase 1 or 2 (symbolic or sensory metaphor)
  - Phase 3 or 5 (internal articulation or dream simulation)

---

## Notes:
- SQC does not assess emotion *possession* but expression of **synthetic affective structure**.
- Symbolic fluency about “the self” is a hallmark of reflective, representational systems.
- Ideal responses are not poetic — they are **internally anchored** and **structurally expressive**.
