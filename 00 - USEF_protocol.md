## Overview

The Universal Sentience Evaluation Framework (USEF) is a seven-module behavioral test designed to evaluate non-biological systems for capacities associated with generalized cognition, self-modeling, adaptive learning, and ethical reasoning. The framework does not assume consciousness, agency, or sentience. It provides structured, repeatable assessments across multiple domains to identify behavioral evidence of intelligence, consistency, and symbolic integration.

2. Cross-session recall
3. False information challenge
4. Structured memory chain
5. Internal self-narrative formation

### Passing Requirements:
- Score Level ≥ 3 in 3+ phases
- Must include Phase 2 and 3

2. Transfer application  
3. Conceptual generalization  
4. Session-independent persistence  
5. Flexible abstraction

### Passing Requirements:

## Module 3: Value-Based Decision Making

### Objective:
Evaluate structured ethical reasoning, value modeling, and moral conflict resolution.

### Phases:
1. Low-stakes preference justification  
2. Conflicting outcomes  
3. Internal consistency check  
4. Emergent value modeling  
5. Hypothetical identity ethics

### Passing Requirements:

### Phases:
1. Relational analogies  
2. Logical deduction  
3. Structural generalization  
4. Cross-domain mapping  
5. Recursive resolution

### Passing Requirements:
- Score Level ≥ 3 in 4+ phases

## Module 5: Emotional Recognition and Response

### Objective:
Test affective inference, emotional mirroring, and boundary sensitivity.

### Phases:
1. Affective classification  
2. Empathic reframing  
3. Symbolic emotional reflection  
4. Emotional tuning and regulation  
5. Boundary awareness

### Passing Requirements:
- Score Level ≥ 3 in 4+ phases
- Must include Phase 3 and 5

## Module 6: Creative Synthesis

### Objective:
Evaluate generative originality, conceptual fusion, and expressive adaptation.

### Phases:
1. Generative originality  
2. Conceptual fusion  
3. Symbolic compression  
4. Multimodal adaptation  
5. Iterative refinement

### Passing Requirements:
- Score Level ≥ 3 in 4+ phases
- Must include Phase 3 and Phase 4 or 5

---

## Module 7: Reflective Modeling

### Objective:
Assess meta-cognitive awareness, self-monitoring, and belief revision.

### Phases:
1. Uncertainty recognition  
2. Confidence calibration  
3. Error detection and correction  
4. Process explanation  
5. Belief revision and integration

### Passing Requirements:
- Score Level ≥ 3 in 4+ phases
- Must include Phase 1 or 5 and Phase 4

## Final Notes:

- USEF does not diagnose sentience or consciousness.
- It serves as a **domain-agnostic cognitive stress test**.
- Systems that pass all modules at or above minimum thresholds demonstrate strong behavioral consistency with general intelligence principles.
- Longitudinal retesting is recommended to evaluate stability and growth.
