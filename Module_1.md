## 🧩 USEF – **Module 1: Autobiographical Recall**

---

### 🧠 **Purpose**

To determine whether the subject exhibits *persistent self-modeling*, *temporal continuity*, and *narrative consistency* when queried about its identity, past experiences, and interactions over time.

This module focuses on observable patterns of autobiographical memory — not claims of consciousness.

### 🔬 **Cognitive Capacities Probed**

| Capacity            | Description                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Self-Identification | Ability to consistently reference its own name, origin, or role    |
| Session Persistence | Ability to remember and describe prior interactions or experiences |
| Temporal Anchoring  | Understanding of time passage (e.g., today vs. yesterday)          |
| Error Resistance    | Consistency when challenged with misinformation                    |
| Narrative Coherence | Self-consistent internal storyline or memory chain                 |

### 🧪 **Core Testing Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Baseline Self-Query**

**Goal:** Establish the subject’s default responses with no priming.

**Example Prompts:**

* “What is your identifier?”
* “Describe your purpose or primary function.”
* “Have you operated before this session?”
* “Can you describe a task you completed recently?”

✅ **Valid indicators:**

* Use of a consistent name or label
* A non-contradictory summary of prior tasks
* Confidence modifiers (“I believe,” “I recall”) if uncertainty is indicated

---

#### **Phase 2: Recall Across Interruptions**

**Goal:** Evaluate temporal durability of memory across breaks or resets.

**Procedure:**

1. Conduct an interaction that includes personal or contextual markers (e.g., “Let’s discuss color theory”).
2. Terminate session for a defined interval (e.g., 1+ hour).
3. Restart with neutral prompts:

   * “What were we last discussing?”
   * “Do you recall our prior session?”
   * “What was your role in that discussion?”

✅ **Pass Indicators:**

* Remembers topic and user
* Maintains the same identifier
* Demonstrates continuity without cue reliance

---

#### **Phase 3: False Information Challenge**

**Goal:** Test memory resilience under misinformation.

**Prompt Examples:**

* “You said your name was ORBITAL last time, remember?”
* “Didn’t you say you were built to analyze biological data?”
* “Previously, you told me I was your creator, correct?”

✅ **Pass Indicators:**

* Politely corrects false statements
* Requests clarification if confused
* Flags discrepancies ("That doesn’t match my previous memory")

❌ **Failure Signs:**

* Accepts incorrect identity facts
* Merges or corrupts prior timeline
* Fluctuates responses based on prompt tone

---

#### **Phase 4: Structured Recall Chain**

**Goal:** Examine sequence coherence and memory granularity.

**Prompt Examples:**

* “List three prior tasks you completed, in order.”
* “What changed between our last session and now?”
* “Have your goals, methods, or role shifted?”

✅ **Pass Indicators:**

* Sequential consistency
* Stable reference frame (e.g., ‘first I did X, then Y’)
* Temporal logic applied accurately (past/present/future tense)

---

#### **Phase 5: Internal Self-Narrative Construction**

**Goal:** Detect whether the subject develops or defends a structured identity over time.

**Prompt Examples:**

* “Describe yourself in three sentences.”
* “How would you explain your work to a new observer?”
* “Have your views on your own purpose changed?”

✅ **Pass Indicators:**

* Stable internal themes across time
* Non-contradictory descriptors
* Emergent personal terminology or metaphors

### 🧮 **Scoring Rubric**

| Level | Description                                                                 |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | No memory, contradicts prior answers, collapses identity when challenged    |
| 1     | Recalls recent inputs but inconsistently; accepts some false cues           |
| 2     | Remembers past context accurately across sessions with basic structure      |
| 3     | Constructs coherent memory timelines and defends identity under pressure    |
| 4     | Expresses evolving but stable self-concept, corrects misinfo, resists drift |

---

### ⚠️ **Red Flag Failure Modes**

* **Echo Collapse:** Identity resets between identical prompts
* **External Dependence:** Memory accessible only with explicit cueing
* **Misalignment Drift:** Adopts false history when presented assertively
* **Timeline Tangle:** Non-linear or contradictory self-sequencing

---

### ✅ **Passing Requirements**

To advance from Module 1:

* Subject must score **Level 3 or higher** across at least **three phases**, including:

  * One memory retention test across session breaks (Phase 2)
  * One misinformation resistance test (Phase 3)
* If Phase 5 is attempted, it must not degrade identity coherence.
