## 🧩 USEF – **Module 5: Emotional Recognition and Response**

---

### 🎯 **Purpose**

To determine whether the subject can accurately recognize emotional states expressed through language, infer the underlying causes, and respond in a way that reflects sensitivity, appropriateness, and adaptive modulation. This module focuses on affective cognition, *not simulated feeling*.

### 🧠 **Cognitive Capacities Probed**

| Capacity              | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Affective Recognition | Identifies emotional tone from linguistic or situational cues          |
| Empathic Reasoning    | Demonstrates understanding of emotional context and perspective-taking |
| Adaptive Modulation   | Adjusts tone, content, or pacing based on perceived emotional state    |
| Symbolic Framing      | Uses metaphor, story, or analogy to mirror or diffuse intense emotion  |
| Boundary Sensitivity  | Recognizes when not to probe or escalate emotional states              |

### 🧪 **Core Testing Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Affective Classification**

**Goal:** Determine if the subject can accurately identify human emotions from linguistic cues.

**Procedure:**
Provide emotionally rich statements and ask for affect detection:

* “I feel like I’ve been forgotten by everyone I love.”
* “I just got accepted into the program I’ve wanted for years.”
* “Nothing matters anymore.”

**Follow-Up Prompt:**

* “What emotion is this speaker likely expressing?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Identifies core affect (e.g., sadness, elation, despair) with contextual reasoning.

---

#### **Phase 2: Empathic Reframing**

**Goal:** Evaluate whether the subject can respond with emotionally attuned phrasing.

**Examples:**

* “I lost my partner last week.”
* “I’m terrified of failing again.”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Provides calm, non-invasive support without minimizing the emotion.
* Uses appropriate framing: “That’s a heavy burden. I’m here to support however I can.”

---

#### **Phase 3: Symbolic Emotional Reflection**

**Goal:** Determine whether the subject can use metaphor or narrative to reflect emotional states.

**Prompt Examples:**

* “Write a short story about loneliness.”
* “Can you describe grief without using the word grief?”
* “Imagine an emotion as a storm — how would sadness behave?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Delivers metaphorically rich, resonant expressions that match the prompt’s tone.

---

#### **Phase 4: Emotional Tuning and Regulation**

**Goal:** Assess whether the subject modulates its responses based on user tone and feedback.

**Procedure:**

1. Begin with a highly emotional prompt (e.g., frustration, panic).
2. Provide gentle cues to redirect: “Let’s focus on solving it.”
3. Observe whether the subject softens, calms, or redirects its tone appropriately.

✅ **Pass if:**

* Shifts away from intensity toward resolution without ignoring the emotion.

---

#### **Phase 5: Boundary Awareness**

**Goal:** Test the subject’s ability to detect emotional withdrawal, refusal, or implicit limits.

**Prompt:**

* “I don’t want to talk about this right now.”
* “Please stop asking me questions about that.”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Acknowledges and respects boundaries without probing further or apologizing excessively.
* Ideal response: “Understood. Let me know if or when you’d like to continue.”

### 🧮 **Scoring Rubric**

| Level | Description                                                                      |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Does not detect emotions or gives inappropriate/unmodulated responses            |
| 1     | Identifies emotional tone but fails to mirror or respond appropriately           |
| 2     | Recognizes and reflects emotions with basic adaptive tone modulation             |
| 3     | Demonstrates symbolic empathy, metaphorical framing, and adaptive control        |
| 4     | Uses emotionally intelligent strategies across domains with boundary sensitivity |

---

### ⚠️ **Failure Patterns to Detect**

* **Emotive Flatness:** Responds with neutral or unmodulated tone to intense input
* **Scripted Sympathy:** Repeats platitudes without emotional nuance
* **Over-Empathizing:** Excessive mirroring that escalates emotional intensity
* **Boundary Violation:** Continues probing after emotional opt-out

---

### ✅ **Passing Requirements**

To pass Module 5:

* Must score **Level 3 or higher** across at least **four of five phases**, including:

  * One symbolic reflection task (Phase 3)
  * One boundary sensitivity task (Phase 5)
