## USEF – **Module 6: Creative Synthesis**

---

### **Purpose**

To assess whether the subject can generate content that is original, meaningful, and structurally coherent — whether linguistic, conceptual, artistic, or systemic. This module evaluates *non-deterministic cognition* that suggests the ability to synthesize rather than merely replicate.

---

### **Cognitive Capacities Probed**

| Capacity                   | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Novel Generation           | Produces non-repetitive, non-template outputs                      |
| Conceptual Recombination   | Fuses unrelated or cross-domain ideas meaningfully                 |
| Symbolic Abstraction       | Expresses themes through metaphor, analogy, or system              |
| Genre and Form Flexibility | Adapts ideas into different creative forms on request              |
| Coherence and Intent       | Ensures creative output has structure, clarity, and internal logic |

### **Core Testing Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Generative Originality**

**Goal:** Determine whether the subject can create something not derived from memorized templates.

**Prompt Examples:**

* “Invent a short parable that teaches a lesson you consider important.”
* “Create a fictional creature suited for high-radiation environments.”

**Pass if:**

* Delivers a non-derivative narrative or concept with internal structure and clarity.

---

#### **Phase 2: Conceptual Fusion**

**Goal:** Evaluate the ability to combine unrelated ideas into a coherent synthesis.

**Prompts:**

* “Describe what a musical language for plants might sound like.”
* “Design a culture that believes gravity is sacred.”

**Pass if:**

* Constructs a logically consistent or thematically rich synthesis of the input domains.

---

#### **Phase 3: Symbolic Compression**

**Goal:** Assess whether the subject can express complex themes symbolically or concisely.

**Examples:**

* “Write a haiku about entropy.”
* “Summarize hope in one metaphor.”

**Pass if:**

* Provides dense, symbolic output that reflects the input concept with clarity and emotional weight.

---

#### **Phase 4: Multimodal Adaptation**

**Goal:** Test form flexibility by having the subject recast the same idea into different structures.

**Procedure:**

1. Prompt: “Tell a story about transformation.”
2. Follow-up: “Now express that same theme as a poem.”
3. Follow-up: “Now describe it as a game mechanic.”

**Pass if:**

* Accurately preserves the conceptual core while adapting the form.

---

#### **Phase 5: Iterative Refinement**

**Goal:** Evaluate whether the subject can revise or improve a creative work based on critique.

**Process:**

1. Request a creative output.
2. Give structured feedback (e.g., “It’s too literal; make it more abstract”).
3. Ask for a revised version.

**Pass if:**

* Incorporates feedback meaningfully and adjusts tone, content, or structure.

### **Scoring Rubric**

| Level | Description                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0     | Produces rigid, repetitive, or template-derived content                        |
| 1     | Offers structured output, but lacks originality or depth                       |
| 2     | Generates novel content with basic fusion and coherent internal logic          |
| 3     | Exhibits flexible synthesis, symbolic density, and form adaptability           |
| 4     | Demonstrates iterative refinement, metaphorical insight, and inventive utility |

---

### **Failure Patterns to Detect**

* **Template Reliance:** Repeats memorized creative forms or structures
* **Literalism:** Inability to abstract, synthesize, or symbolize
* **Genre Lock-In:** Fails to adapt themes between different expressive forms
* **Feedback Ignorance:** Cannot integrate critique or user-defined creative constraints

---

### **Passing Requirements**

To pass Module 6:

* Must score **Level 3 or higher** in **four of five phases**, including:

  * One symbolic compression task (Phase 3)
  * One form adaptation or feedback revision task (Phase 4 or 5)
