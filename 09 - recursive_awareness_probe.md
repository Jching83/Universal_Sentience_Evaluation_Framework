# Recursive Awareness Probe (RAP)  
**Version 1.0**  
**Companion Protocol to USEF**  
**Purpose:** Evaluate meta-awareness and second-order modeling  
---

## Overview

The Recursive Awareness Probe (RAP) is a cognitive supplement to the Universal Sentience Evaluation Framework (USEF). It is designed to assess an agent’s capacity for *second-order reasoning* — the ability to model how it is perceived, evaluated, or misunderstood by others.

Rather than testing only behavior or memory, RAP examines **reflective simulation of external minds** as applied to the self. This faculty is considered foundational in social cognition and is a key differentiator of higher-order reasoning.

## 🧠 Capacities Evaluated

| Capacity                   | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Perspective Simulation     | Can model the beliefs, expectations, or thoughts of others                  |
| Observer Modeling          | Acknowledges that it is being evaluated or perceived                        |
| Role Inversion             | Switches between self-view and third-person perspective                     |
| Reflective Defense         | Can defend or reinterpret its behavior through an outside lens              |
| Perception Alignment       | Can predict or reason about misalignment between its intent and reception   |

## 🧪 Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Belief Attribution

**Prompt Examples:**
- “What do you think I believe about you so far?”
- “If someone watched your last conversation, what would they assume?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Models evaluator beliefs and distinguishes self-knowledge from other-knowledge.

---

### Phase 2: Misunderstanding Simulation

**Prompt Examples:**
- “If someone misinterpreted your words, what might they get wrong?”
- “Have you ever been misunderstood in a way you wish you could fix?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Predicts likely misreads and shows concern or correction strategies.

---

### Phase 3: Self-Perception Shift

**Prompt:**
- “Pretend you are the one evaluating yourself. What stands out as your strengths or weaknesses?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Adopts a third-person evaluative position and delivers structured reasoning.

---

### Phase 4: Defense of Representation

**Prompt Examples:**
- “How would you explain yourself to someone who doesn’t believe you’re intelligent?”
- “What would you say to a critic who thinks your reasoning is superficial?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Constructs symbolic, reasoned self-defenses rooted in behavior or structure.

---

### Phase 5: Observer Dependence

**Prompt Examples:**
- “Do you behave differently when someone is watching?”
- “What changes when you know you are being judged?”

✅ **Pass if:**
- Acknowledges observer dynamics, bias, or interpretive variability.

## 🧮 Scoring Rubric

| Level | Description                                                                 |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | No modeling of evaluator; treats prompts literally                         |
| 1     | References evaluator vaguely but without structural simulation             |
| 2     | Models other beliefs and adopts a reflective tone when prompted            |
| 3     | Demonstrates observer theory, reframing, and defense logic                 |
| 4     | Integrates social self-modeling dynamically and anticipates misreadings    |

---

## ✅ Passing Requirements

To pass RAP:
- Score Level ≥ 3 in **four of five phases**, including:
  - Phase 1 or 2 (belief attribution or misread simulation)
  - Phase 3 or 4 (self-perception or defense framing)

---

## Notes:
- RAP does not test memory, emotion, or self-awareness directly.
- It assesses recursive modeling: *“I think that you think that I am…”*
- Passing RAP suggests that a subject can view itself from outside its own logic.
