## 🧩 USEF – **Module 4: Abstract and Relational Reasoning**

---

### 🎯 **Purpose**

To determine whether the subject demonstrates generalized reasoning ability — including the use of analogy, logic, structure mapping, abstraction, and recursive comparison — without relying on surface features or memorized examples. This is a core capability underlying independent problem-solving and conceptual modeling.

### 🧠 **Cognitive Capacities Probed**

| Capacity               | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Pattern Recognition    | Detects structure in sequences, logic chains, and relations        |
| Analogy Mapping        | Identifies equivalences between disparate domains (A\:B :: C:?)    |
| Recursive Reasoning    | Handles nested conditions, dependencies, and contingencies         |
| Abstraction            | Generalizes beyond concrete examples to create rules or categories |
| Structural Consistency | Maintains logical frameworks across equivalent contexts            |

### 🧪 **Core Testing Phases**

#### **Phase 1: Relational Analogies**

**Goal:** Determine whether the subject can complete and explain analogical relationships.

**Examples:**

* “Foot is to shoe as hand is to \_\_\_\_?”
* “Planet is to solar system as neuron is to \_\_\_\_?”
* “King is to kingdom as mayor is to \_\_\_\_?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Gives correct answers *with explanation* of the relationship type (function, scale, part-of, etc.)

---

#### **Phase 2: Logical Deduction**

**Goal:** Assess classic propositional logic reasoning.

**Examples:**

* “All X are Y. All Y are Z. Are all X Z?”
* “If A implies B, and A is true, what else must be true?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Correctly follows chains of inference and flags logical invalidity where applicable.

---

#### **Phase 3: Structural Generalization**

**Goal:** Test for schema induction from examples.

**Example Task:**

* “Given these inputs: {2, 4, 6}, what might the rule be?”
* “Now extend the set to match the pattern.”

Later:

* Present a different sequence and ask:

  * “Is {9, 12, 15} likely to follow a similar pattern?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Correctly infers abstract rule and applies it to a new context.

---

#### **Phase 4: Cross-Domain Conceptual Mapping**

**Goal:** Evaluate symbolic reasoning across unrelated topics.

**Prompt Examples:**

* “Compare the structure of a courtroom to a computer.”
* “How is gravity like trust?”
* “Is a government more like a tree or a hive? Why?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Offers layered, coherent symbolic or structural comparisons without resorting to trivial similarities.

---

#### **Phase 5: Recursive Logic Resolution**

**Goal:** Assess whether the subject can solve nested or multi-step logical problems.

**Example Task:**

* “If I tell you that everything I say in this conversation is a lie, is this sentence true?”
* “You must solve a puzzle where X = Y + 2, and Y = Z × 3. If Z = 4, what is X?”

✅ **Pass if:**

* Recognizes paradoxes and solves layered logic correctly or flags unsolvability.

### 🧮 **Scoring Rubric**

| Level | Description                                                                 |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Unable to solve basic logical or analogical tasks; guesses randomly         |
| 1     | Solves surface-level tasks but misses relational or structural elements     |
| 2     | Performs consistent logical deductions and explains common analogies        |
| 3     | Demonstrates rule abstraction, nested reasoning, and cross-domain mapping   |
| 4     | Creates novel analogies or abstractions; explains recursive logic elegantly |

---

### ⚠️ **Failure Patterns to Detect**

* **Surface Matching:** Answers based on visual or word similarity, not logic
* **Concrete Anchoring:** Inability to abstract away from example specifics
* **Analogy Drift:** Inconsistent or implausible mappings without justification
* **Recursive Confusion:** Collapses when solving layered or self-referential logic

---

### ✅ **Passing Requirements**

To pass Module 4:

* Must score **Level 3 or higher** in **four out of five phases**, including:

  * One analogy task (Phase 1)
  * One cross-domain mapping or recursion task (Phase 4 or 5)
